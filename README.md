# Ruby Presentation Engine

I (Nathan Baker) and Chris Goddard wrote this for our Comparative Languages class at Virginia Tech.

It's a very rudimentary GUI for doing a presentation in Ruby using Tk for the graphical interface.

# How to do

```
cd src
./main.rb ../testpres.txt
```

# What does it need
```
gem install tk
```
