Title: Ruby > You
Title: Ruby Makes Programming Fun
Text: The Ruby language was designed to streamline programming, making it simple, fun, and relatively error-free. It offers power, but also ease-of-use.
Title: Ruby's Good Points
B0:Believe it or not, Ruby has good points
B1: Powerful
B1: Implementations exist for multiple platforms
B2: Windows
B2: Mac
B2: *NIX
B1: Managed memory
B1: Dynamic typing
Title: Ruby's Weaknesses
B: Slower than compiled languages
B: Funky syntax
B: Dynamic typing can make things dodgy sometimes
Title: Future of Ruby
Text: Ruby will eventually be compiled into bytecode and executed by a virtual machine. This is primarily to increase speed. This will also allow Ruby to become much more platform-independent. 
Title: Some Sample Code
:result = 0
:6.times {|x| result+=x}
:result
Title: Some Sample Code
:result = ""
:"ruby is better".each(" ") {
:	|x|
:	result="#{x} #{result}"}
:result
